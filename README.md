ðŸš€ Internship Task at SkillCraft Technology

As part of my internship at SkillCraft Technology, I was assigned the task of creating a landing webpage with a focus on designing and implementing an interactive navigation bar âœ¨.

The main objective was to ensure the navigation menu was not only visually appealing but also user-friendly. I implemented the following features:

ðŸ”¹ ðŸŒˆ Dynamic Styling â€“ The navigation bar changes its color and style when a user hovers over menu items or scrolls through the page, adding an engaging interactive effect.
ðŸ”¹ ðŸ“Œ Fixed Position Navbar â€“ The menu remains visible at the top of the screen on all pages, allowing smooth and consistent navigation.
ðŸ”¹ ðŸ’» Clean UI with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript â€“ The project focuses on simplicity and modern design, showcasing the practical use of front-end technologies.

This task gave me an excellent opportunity to strengthen my front-end development skills, particularly in working with styling, interactivity, and fixed positioning for better user experience. It also taught me the importance of small details in web design that can make a big difference in usability ðŸŒŸ.
